# The original Full stack application is developed by https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/twitter-clone. All the credit for the application development goes to him and I do not intend to take any credit for it. 

# What I have done is Dockerized this app, which was a complicated task because it uses prisma with MongoDB, we need MongoDB replica sets to establish the connectivity between prisma and MongoDB. After hours of trying to fix the problem, I think I have found the fix.

# Please feel free to Check out the Dockerize version.

 

# Build and Deploy: TWITTER clone - Chwitter with React, Tailwind, Next, Prisma, Mongo, NextAuth & Docker
