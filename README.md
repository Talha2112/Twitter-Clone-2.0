## The original Full stack application is developed by https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/twitter-clone. All the credit for the application development goes to him and I do not intend to take any credit for it. 

## What I have done is Dockerized this app, which was a complicated task because it uses prisma with MongoDB, we need MongoDB replica sets to establish the connectivity between prisma and MongoDB.

## For the original app Antonio uses MongoDB Atlas and Vercel to deploy the app, but I wanted to dockerize it so that we can run it on our local machine and to experience what itactually takes to create a containerized app. It took some effort but it's done. 

## Please feel free to check out the Dockerized version.
